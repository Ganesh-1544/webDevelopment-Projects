              <li>  We're past the days when pizza was the primary food delivery option. 
                You can now get almost any food imaginable delivered to your door without getting out of your pajamas. </li>

 <li>Food delivery services, such as Postmates, GrubHub and DoorDash, can bring you meals from your 
favorite chain restaurant or the local diner.</li> <li> With so many food delivery service apps, figuring 
out the best one can be hard.</li> <li>We've evaluated how easy it is to use these apps, how many
 restaurants each app works with, how steep the delivery and service fees are and how long 
 the estimated delivery time is for each.  </li>

 <li>  We selected restaurants near each other and about 5 miles from a suburban location. 
We also examined how delivery to an urban area influenced time and costs.</li><li> We ordered 
similarly priced items from all locations in each app to help determine additional fees,
 and we looked at these services around midday during the week in February.</li>

  <li>Here's a roundup of our favorite food delivery service apps that you can download from the
 Apple App Store or the Google Play store. </li>

 <li>Note: Your experience will likely vary depending on your location, dietary restrictions,
 the time of day you order and any available promotions. </li>
    <li> The riders and drivers for nearly all independent restaurant delivery app services
  are independent contractors, having the flexibility to choose when they work.</li>
  <li> In Australia, specifically riders for the food app of Foodora, consider themselves
    employees because they sometimes work full time hours, are required to wear uniforms, 
    and run shift system. </li>

 <li>  However, food delivery riders and drivers usually do not receive any insurance coverage,
 protective gear, or sick pay as independent contractors, which have led to some
  asking for improved safety standards.</li> <li> In response, Deliveroo gave riders a helmet
   with a GoPro camera to record any problems they may face, specifically with criminals. </li>
   <li> The riders have the opportunity to raise safety concerns about delivery areas in the app. </li>
